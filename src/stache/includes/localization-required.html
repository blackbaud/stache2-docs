    Stache makes use of the <a stacheRouterLink="https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux/learn/get-started/advanced/localization">SKY UX localization</a> feature. This feature requires users be on <stache-code>SKY UX Builder 1.14.0</stache-code> or higher. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Until an update can be made within SKY UX, consumers of Stache are required to include a <stache-code>src/assets/locales/resources_en_US.json</stache-code> file in their project to render the components and their text correctly.
