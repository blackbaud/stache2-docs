    Stache welcomes contributions from anyone. In order to contribute, a better understanding of Stache and how it functions as a whole is required. Stache is comprised of two main pieces: components and plugins.

    Components
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <p>
    Stache components are the primary vechicle for consuming Stache. These components come in two flavors: content creation and structural. The content creation components are components consumed directly by users to author content. These are the components listed on the <a routerLink="/components">content</a> page.
  </p>

  <p>
    Structural components serve a more behind the scenes purpose. They facilitate and enhance the content creation components by abstracting away a lot of complexity. These components are not meant to be used directly for content creation. Many of these structural components are combined to create layouts, which serve as the skeleton for Stache pages. For example, the sidebar layout is comprised of the <sky-code>stache-sidebar</sky-code>, <sky-code>stache-layout</sky-code>, <sky-code>stache-breadcrumbs</sky-code>, <sky-code>stache-page-header</sky-code>, and <sky-code>stache-table-of-contents</sky-code> components.
  </p>

  <p>
    When creating new components, it is important to consider this distinction. Will this component be used directly by consumers to create content? Or is this more of a configuration or structural component that is better used in a layout? For example, a content creator would create a block quote, but would never manually generate a table of contents.

    Plugins

  <p>
    The other crucial piece of Stache is the plugin. Plugins serve to modify and manipulate components, services, and configuration at build time and are vital to many core features of Stache. Many of the global configuration settings and data services, such as the <sky-code>Stache Data Service</sky-code> and the <sky-code>Stache Http Service</sky-code> are compiled and injected through plugins during build. Some components even require build time compilation to overcome run time limitations, such as the <sky-code>stache-include</sky-code> and the <sky-code>sky-code-block</sky-code> components.
  </p>

  <p>
    Plugins live in a <a href="https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-builder-plugin-stache">separate code base <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> outside of the core Stache project. You can read more about the plugin framework in the repo's README.
