    Stache Documentation Update (2018-03-07)
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <stache-markdown>
- For Blackbaud staff, we created a new template for you. Thanks to Bobby Earl for his work to update the [SKY UX CLI (1.2.0) <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to support the internal template Git URL.
- To use the new template, Blackbaud staff should follow the new <a href="https://docs.blackbaud.com/stache-internal/new-bb-stache" title="Blackbaud staff users only">Create a New Stache SPA tutorial<i class="fa fa-lock" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.
- Added a tutorial for how to [migrate from Stache 1](/stache/learn/migrate).
- Added a [Troubleshooting](/stache/support/troubleshoot) page to help you problem solve issues you may encounter.
- Added external link icons <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>, to better warn you when you are leaving our website for another.
- Added a locked icon <i class="fa fa-lock" aria-hidden="true"></i>, to show links that are restricted to Blackbaud staff only.
- Updated the [home page](/stache/) to show Blackbaud staff specific benefits.
- Based on feedback, we made improvements to the [Getting Started](/stache/learn/get-started) documentation. To better guide Blackbaud staff with Stache SPAs, we also included an improvement to the SKY UX App Management Portal. (Thank you, SKY UX Team!)
- Added a [Why Stache?](/stache/support/why-stache) page to better explain the details of Stache, including what it is, the benefits, the features, and when to use what.
- Moved documentation (layouts, links, and navigation) from the Basics page to the [Content](/stache/content) page.
- For Blackbaud staff, we created a new Stache SPA (stache-internal) to provide *internal to Blackbaud only* documentation. This enables us to provide very specific information for you, without "mucking up" documentation that's applicable to all users. As part of this, we created a centralized location for <a href="https://docs.blackbaud.com/stache-internal/search" title="Blackbaud staff only">Stache Search Service <i class="fa fa-lock" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> documentation. This means it's now available to find in the <a href="https://docs.blackbaud.com/stache-internal/search" title="Blackbaud staff only">global Stache search <i class="fa fa-lock" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
