    NPM install
  </stache-page-anchor>
  <h3>
    Scenarios
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>When you were running
        <stache-code>skyux new --template stache</stache-code> or
        <stache-code>npm install</stache-code>, did the install time out?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Are you having a problem serving your site locally?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Did you update the dependencies in the
        <stache-code>package.json</stache-code> file?</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Solution
  </h3>
  <p>
    You may want to re-run
    <stache-code>npm install</stache-code>. Before you do that, we recommend you delete your entire
    <stache-code>node_modules</stache-code> folder. In the command line for the Stache site folder, enter
    <stache-code>npm cache clear</stache-code>. When that completes, enter
    <stache-code>npm install</stache-code>.
  </p>

  <stache-page-anchor>
    Page isn't loading locally
  </stache-page-anchor>
  <h3>
    Scenario
  </h3>
  <p>
    When you run
    <stache-code>skyux serve</stache-code>, does a browser window open to your "in-dev" site, but all you see is a bouncing green ball
    and the page doesn't load?
  </p>

  <h3>
    Solution
  </h3>
  <p>
    When this happens, it means there's an error in the code for your Stache site. We recommend you use the browser developer
    tools to find the error. For example, in Chrome, right-click on the page and select
    <strong>Inspect</strong>. Then, select the Console tab. Do you see a lot of red text? Scroll up to the top to see if you can
    find a clue to locate the error in the code.
  </p>
  <p>Common issues we've noticed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Did you provide an opening tag, like
      <stache-code escapeCharacters="true">&lt;stache-page-anchor&gt;</stache-code> but not the closing one like
      <stache-code escapeCharacters="true">&lt;/stache-page-anchor&gt;</stache-code>?
    </li>
    <li>
      Check your JSON files for errors. These can include unnecessary commas, missing commas, unncessary spaces, unncessary tabs,
      missing characters (
      <stache-code escapeCharacters="true">{</stache-code>,
      <stache-code escapeCharacters="true">[</stache-code>,
      <stache-code escapeCharacters="true">}</stache-code>,
      <stache-code escapeCharacters="true">]</stache-code>, etc), and improper formatting.
    </li>
    <li>
      Did you use punctionation, like a <stache-code>-</stache-code>, when you reference json files from a page? For example, when you use the action buttons component, don't use punctuation (ex. dashes) in your unique filename.
    </li>
    <li>
      Did you reference an image that wasn't added to your assets folder?
    </li>
    <li>
      Did you misspell a component? For example, if you reference <stache-code>stace-code</stache-code> instead of <stache-code>stache-code</stache-code>, your SPA will try to find that misspelled component and fail.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you've made a recent change and everything looks good, you can also stop serving and serve again to see if that fixes
    the issue. If not, keep looking because there's an error in there somewhere. Still can't find it?

    Formatting issues in VS Code
  </stache-page-anchor>
  <h3>
    Scenario
  </h3>
  <p>
    When you paste HTML content into VS Code and use the Markdown component, does it automatically format the content to add indentations that render the page as a code block?
  </p>
  <h3>
    Solution
  </h3>
  <p>
    Edit your VS Code settings for formatting pasted content. Select <b>Files</b>, <b>Preferences</b>, <b>Settings</b>, and in User Settings, add <stache-code>"editor.formatOnPaste": false</stache-code> to the list.
