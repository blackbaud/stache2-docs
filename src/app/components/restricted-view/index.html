      The Restricted View Library makes content visible to internal Blackbaud users and hides it from other users. This library is for internal Blackbaud use only.
    </p>
    <p *skyRestrictedView>
      The Restricted View Library includes a component and directive that both allow you to configure content. The library enables you to create a more targeted user experience in Blackbaud documentation by only showing content that applies to users.

    Installation
  </stache-page-anchor>
  <p>
    To use exports from the Restricted View Library library, you must install <sky-code>SkyRestrictedViewModule</sky-code> as a dependency to your project. In the command prompt, run the following command from your SPA's root directory:
  </p>
  <sky-code-block>
    npm install --save --save-exact @blackbaud/skyux-lib-restricted-view
  </sky-code-block>
  <p>
    After installation, you need to make any exports from <sky-code>SkyRestrictedViewModule</sky-code> available to your SPA by adding the module to the <sky-code>exports</sky-code> section of your SPA's main module. If you are using the SKY UX SDK, add <sky-code>SkyRestrictedViewModule</sky-code> as an export in your <sky-code>app-sky.module.ts</sky-code> file.
