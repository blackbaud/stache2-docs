    <p>
      The Markdown component enables users to write Markdown in their HTML files. Within the <stache-code>stache-markdown</stache-code> tags, users can mix Markdown and HTML elements to create documentation with Markdown without losing out on {{ stache.jsonData.global.productNameLong }} features.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Stache-specific Markdown
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Page anchors — The <stache-code>##</stache-code> syntax creates an <stache-code>h2</stache-code> heading with a <a routerLink="/content/page-anchor">Stache page anchor</a> around it, and adds the heading to the table of contents. To create a regular <stache-code>h2</stache-code>, simply use the HTML <stache-code escapeCharacters="true"><h2></stache-code> tags.
      </li>
      <li>
        Code snippets — The <stache-code>`</stache-code> syntax creates a <a routerLink="/content/code">Stache code snippet</a>. To use the <stache-code>escapeCharacters</stache-code> attribute escape special characters, you must use the actual <stache-code>stache-code</stache-code> element.
      </li>
      <li>
        Code blocks — The <stache-code>```</stache-code> syntax creates a <a routerLink="/content/code-block">Stache code block</a>. You can specify a language directly after the opening <stache-code>```</stache-code>. For example, <stache-code>```json</stache-code> creates a <stache-code>stache-code-block</stache-code> element with the <stache-code>languageType</stache-code> attribute set to <stache-code>json</stache-code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </stache-page-summary>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<p>To ensure your content displays correctly, avoid using the following components within the <stache-code>stache-markdown</stache-code> tags.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cards</li>
    <li>Code block</li>
    <li>Grid</li>
    <li>Includes (the component renders except when the content includes the code block component)</li>
    <li>Page summary</li>
    <li>Text expand</li>
  </ul>
<p>We recommend you close the Markdown component before using the components listed above to avoid issues. You can always add a new Markdown tag if you want to continue writing in Markdown after the Stache component.</p>

  Lots of content on a Stache 1 site, and we've been dragging our feet a bit on migrating due to lack of Markdown support.

#### Dear Reluctant engineer faced with an enormous amount of work,

*We heard you, and we are here to help! With the <stache-code escapeCharacters="true"><stache-markdown></stache-code> tags, we can save you time copying over all that Markdown!*

  I would love to migrate our Stache site to Stache 2, but I think something that really works for our team is the simple Markdown experience. From my understanding, Stache 2 does not have baked-in support for Markdown.

*Now we do! We hope this Markdown experience helps you and your team come to love {{ stache.jsonData.global.productNameLong }}.*
