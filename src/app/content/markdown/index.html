      The markdown component is used to allow users to write markdown inside their HTML files. Within these tags you can mix markdown and HTML elements to write your documentation in MD without losing out on all the features of {{ stache.jsonData.global.productNameLong }}.

    <h3>
      Stache specific markdown

    <ul>
      <li>
        <stache-code>Page Anchors</stache-code> - Using the <stache-code>##</stache-code> for an h2 tag will create a <a routerLink="/content/page-anchor">stache page anchor</a> around the title, and add it to the <stache-code>table of contents</stache-code>.
      </li>
      <sky-alert alertType="info">
        If you want to use a regular <stache-code>h2</stache-code>, simply use the HTML <stache-code escapeCharacters="true"><h2></stache-code> inside your markdown.
      </sky-alert>
      <li>
        <stache-code>Codeblock</stache-code> - Using the <stache-code>```</stache-code> to wrap a codeblock in the markdown component will create a <a routerLink="/content/code-block">stache code block</a>. Directly following the opening <stache-code>```</stache-code> marks, you can specify your languageType for the codeblock.
        eg: <stache-code>```js</stache-code> will create a <stache-code>stache-code-block</stache-code> with the languagetype of <stache-code>js</stache-code>.

  I would love to the migrate [our] Stache site to stache v2, but I think something that really works for our team is the simple markdown experience. From my understanding, stache v2 does not have baked-in support for markdown.

#### Dear Doesn’t want to tell his team that they have to give up markdown,

*Now we do! We hope this markdown experience helps you and your team come to love {{ stache.jsonData.global.productNameLong }}.*
