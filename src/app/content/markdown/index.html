      The Markdown component allows users to write Markdown in their HTML files. Within the <stache-code>stache-markdown</stache-code> tags, users can mix Markdown and HTML elements to create documentation with Markdown without losing out on {{ stache.jsonData.global.productNameLong }} features.

          Page anchors — The <stache-code>##</stache-code> syntax creates an <stache-code>h2</stache-code> heading with a <a routerLink="/content/page-anchor">Stache page anchor</a> around it and adds the heading to the table of contents.
        </p>
        <sky-alert alertType="info">
          To create a regular <stache-code>h2</stache-code>, simply use the HTML <stache-code escapeCharacters="true"><h2></stache-code> tags.

      </li>
      <li>

          Code snippets — The <stache-code>`</stache-code> syntax creates a <a routerLink="/content/code">Stache code snippet</a>.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Code blocks — The <stache-code>```</stache-code> syntax creates a <a routerLink="/content/code-block">Stache code block</a>. You can specify a language directly after the opening <stache-code>```</stache-code>. For example, <stache-code>```js</stache-code> creates a <stache-code>stache-code-block</stache-code> element with the <stache-code>languageType</stache-code> attribute set to <stache-code>js</stache-code>.

  Lots of content on a Stache 1 site, and we've been dragging our feet a bit on migrating due to lack of Markdown support.

#### Dear Reluctant engineer faced with an enormous amount of work,

*We heard you, and we are here to help! With the <stache-code escapeCharacters="true"><stache-markdown></stache-code> tags, we can save you time copying over all that Markdown!*

<stache-blockquote
  author="Doesn’t want to tell his team that they have to give up Markdown">
  I would love to migrate our Stache site to Stache 2, but I think something that really works for our team is the simple Markdown experience. From my understanding, Stache 2 does not have baked-in support for Markdown.
</stache-blockquote>

#### Dear Doesn’t want to tell his team that they have to give up Markdown,

*Now we do! We hope this Markdown experience helps you and your team come to love {{ stache.jsonData.global.productNameLong }}.*
