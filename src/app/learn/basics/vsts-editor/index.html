      <stache-tutorial-step-body>
        <p>
          After you commit all of your edits, you need to create a pull request for your branch. When you commit a change, you'll see a message with your commit summary and a <stache-code>Create a pull request</stache-code> link. Select the link, or create a pull request from the Pull Requests page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter a title and description for your pull request, and clear the <strong>Reviewers</strong> field. When you save your pull request, the repository's required reviewers are automatically added. After the build passes, the Project Collection Build Service account adds a comment to your pull request with a link to a site where you can preview your changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can make additional edits and commit them to your branch after creating your pull request. After each pull request, a build runs your changes. When it successfully completes, the Project Collection Build Service account posts a new comment with a new link that incorporates those changes. When you're happy with your changes, select  <strong>Complete</strong> or <strong>Set auto-complete</strong> to mark the pull request as ready to release. Once one of the reviewers for that repository review and approve your changes, they will be merged into the master branch and your branch will be deleted. Create a new branch and repeat this process the next time you want to edit the site.
