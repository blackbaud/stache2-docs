    Stache Wrapper
  </stache-page-anchor>
  <p>
    The Stache Wrapper is the primary tag in a Stache project, and contains all the other Stache tags and content. Most of your page level configuration is done through the Stache Wrapper, including layouts and navigation. Typically, this is the first tag you will want to add to any Stache page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stache takes a prescriptive approach to configuration. Most of the properties on the Stache tag have defaults, so you will rarely have to set them yourself. The main exception is the page title.
