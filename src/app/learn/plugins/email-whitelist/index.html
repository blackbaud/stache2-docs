  <stache-page-summary>
    The Email Whitelist plugin restricts access to a SKYUX SPA to only users with valid Blackbaud email addresses. Stache sites can be made accessible to users out outside of Blackbaud, but before you remove the plugin, carefully review the guidelines.

<stache-page-anchor>Review Process</stache-page-anchor>
<p>Before you make a Stache site public, your direct manager should review the site's content, which can be done by providing them with a link to the open pull request. Additionally, you must also contact a member of the <a href="mailto:RDOSDKAPIusereducationteam@blackbaud.com"> Blackbaud Content Design and Delivery (CD&D) Engineering</a> team to review the content.</p>

<sky-alert alertType="warning">Failure to contact the CD&D Engineering team for review could result in your site's removal.</sky-alert>

<stache-page-anchor>Owner Responsibilities</stache-page-anchor>
<p>After the Stache site is public, you're expected to maintain the content and ensure it doesn't become out of date. By default, Stache sites are set up with Google Analytics and monitored by the CD&D Engineering team. If the CD&D Engineering team hasn't seen activity on your site for a 12 month period, you will be contacted and your site will be removed.</p>
