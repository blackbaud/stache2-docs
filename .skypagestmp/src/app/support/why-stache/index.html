    What is it?
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <stache-markdown><p>Stache is a component library for SKY UX SPAs, which means all the goodness of SKY UX plus features customized for documentation. With our documentation patterns and components coupled with SKY UX, you have the ability to create a well-designed and consistent documentation experience optimized for your consumer.</p>
<p>However, Stache isn&#39;t for early collaborative documentation or projects where a team is taking a lot of notes and working through a solution together.</p>
<p>When you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share knowledge, including code, across a wide group</li>
<li>Teach</li>
<li>Onboard</li>
<li>Raise awareness</li>
<li>Provide tooling help content</li>
<li>Optimize your content for an external audience</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, that&#39;s the time you need to invest in creating good documentation. Good documentation can result in less friction for your users learning and understanding. When you enable efficient self-service, you can spend less time answering questions.</p>

    When to use what
  </stache-page-anchor>

  <h3>
    Question #1: Who's going to use your content?
  </h3>
  <p>
    If it's a limited group of people, like a scrum team, then it's up to your group how you want to document team knowledge and processes. Use what's best for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do you have <strong>consumers</strong>? If yes, we strongly recommend you create a Stache site. We want your information to be successfully delivered and used. Our tools and processes support that effort.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Question #2: Is your site going to be public?
  </h3>
  <p>
    If your site is going to be public-facing (now or in the future) to any and all users on the Internet, then the choice is easy. Use Stache. Stache tools and processes help you create documentation orientated for an open site.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Question #3: Do you primarily need to share files?
  </h3>
  <p>
    If the primary purpose of your content is to only share files, like Microsoft Word documents, then don't create a Stache site. If you're a Blackbaud staff, we recommend you use our Office365 tools (SharePoint) to set up a document library instead.
  </p>
